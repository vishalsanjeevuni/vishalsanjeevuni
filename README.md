Welcome to my GitHub repository! As a Data Processing Technician with a strong foundation in data engineering and machine learning, I'm excited to share my latest projects and code related to natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and machine learning.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning, you'll find a variety of experiments and innovative approaches in my code. My experience in the financial services industry has honed my expertise in ETL operations, data analytics, and Python programming. Alongside coding, I'm actively exploring MLOps and cloud technologies such as AWS and Microsoft Azure to enhance the deployment and management of my models.

Feel free to explore my repository and connect with me on LinkedIn to discuss potential collaborations or share insights in the Data Engineering and Machine Learning domains.
